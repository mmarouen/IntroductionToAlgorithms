# Introduction to algorithms implementations and solutions
This book is a review and implementation of the famous book.\
All the content of the book is shared for educational purposes for the benefit of the readers.\
Please feel free to share or use :)
## Content
Each chapter is associated with a `runnable` calling the algorithmic implementations.\
The user is of course free to add additional runnables.\
The repository is broken down into chapters where each chapter implementation contains the algorithms that were presented within.\
The table of content below links the `header` files associated with each chapter along with the relevant `runnable` and a brief description of the algorithms implemented.
Chapter | Runnable | Algorithms
--- | --- | --- |
[Chapter2](lib/include/algorithms/chap2.hpp) | [sorter](src/sort_algs.cpp) | - Insert sort algorithm<br>- Merge sort algorithm
[Chapter4](lib/include/algorithms/chap4.hpp) | [multiplier](src/multiply_matrices.cpp) | - Classical matrix multiplication<br>- Recursive matrix multiplication

## Prerequisites
- `c++`
- `CMake`

> **WARNING**: Implementation was tested on a Ubuntu 20 machine
